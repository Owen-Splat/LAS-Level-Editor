RELEASE v1.0:

Bugs To Fix:
- sometimes an actor's position gets weird when using the arrow keys and it loops before being able to be brought back into the viewport

- fix parameter table saving (might be fixed, need to double check)

Features:
- make rotation visible in some way

- remove text at the bottom of the room view, have a list of actors & their sprites to drag into the room

- remove hide & grid checkboxes, integrate them into standard icon buttons

- add icon buttons to change controls from position, rotation, scale

- add basic lvb support for things like allowing companions in custom dungeons, or changing the music

UI REWORK:
- add romfs and output paths

- create project manager, opening an existing project will open everything

- instead of selecting files, have a grid view of every area to view all rooms at once and select individual rooms to edit

FUTURE:
- rework GUI to be in the same layout, but scalable

- add support for editing gsheet

- make and include a modified event editor, specific to LAS and with easy to choose events & default parameters
